// FP.3 Define a class „MessageQueue“ which has the public methods send and receive. 
// Send should take an rvalue reference of type TrafficLightPhase whereas receive should return this type. 
// Also, the class should define an std::dequeue called _queue, which stores objects of type TrafficLightPhase. 
// Also, there should be an std::condition_variable as well as an std::mutex as private members.
